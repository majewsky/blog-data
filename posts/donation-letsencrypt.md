# Donation to Let's Encrypt

When you visit this blog, the connection will be encrypted and thus
tamper-proof thanks to a free TLS certificate from
[Let's Encrypt][le]. They're currently running a [crowdfunding campaign][cc] to
fund their operational costs. Since I use their service extensively, I gave 50
dollars. If you, too, like the idea of a more secure and privacy-respecting
web, please consider giving generously, too.
