# 70000 commands later: Two-and-a-half years of shell history

Here's a thing that I recently noticed on my notebook:

```bash
$ cd ~; wc -l .histfile
67789 .histfile
```

That's a respectable corpus. Let's analyze it!

## The oldest command

I have configured my shell to basically never drop history. Since the notebook
I'm writing this from has been running for five years now, so I hoped the shell
history would also go back this far. Shell history files sadly do not contain
any timestamps, so some guessing is required. I looked through the first few
lines, and around line 160, I could see myself making [this
commit](https://github.com/juster/perl-alpm/commit/7087cc449428622460da25ae7aaf0c624d9d2e41).
That puts the beginning of the shell history at January 23rd, 2015. I copied
the history file away for analysis on August 3rd, 2017, which amounts for 924
days.

67789 commands over 924 days means about 72 commands per day on average. That's
surprisingly few commands, but it sounds about right when considering that I
spend most of my day at work or at my desktop PC at home.
